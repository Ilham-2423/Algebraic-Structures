# Study of Acts Over Monoids

This project is part of my Bachelor's and Master's research in Mathematics at the Central University of Kashmir (2023–2024).

## 🔍 Overview
This repository explores the algebraic structure of S-acts over monoids. Key areas include:

- Subdirectly irreducible acts
- Congruences on S-acts
- Composition series of subacts

## 🧮 Tools Used
- **LaTeX**: For documentation and formal proof writing
- **Python**: To simulate and visualize monoid operations
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory programming and demonstration

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
- Deep understanding of algebraic structures in abstract algebra
- Linked mathematical theory with programming logic and computer science concepts

## 📂 Files
- `acts_monoids_simulation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with visual and interactive simulations
- `acts_monoids_simulation.py`: Python script version

## 🧠 Future Scope
This work lays the foundation for future studies in categorical algebra and computational logic.
