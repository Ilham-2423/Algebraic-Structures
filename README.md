# Study of Acts Over Monoids

This repository documents my undergraduate research project titled *"A Study of Acts Over Monoids"*, completed as part of my Bachelor's and Master's in Mathematics at the Central University of Kashmir (2023â€“2024).

## Overview

The project explores the algebraic structure of S-acts over monoids with a focus on:

- Subdirectly irreducible acts
- Congruences on S-acts
- Composition series of subacts

## Tools Used

- LaTeX (for formal documentation and mathematical expressions)
- Python (to simulate and visualize monoid operations)

## Learning Outcomes

- Developed a deeper understanding of abstract algebra
- Connected pure mathematical concepts to theoretical computer science and logic
